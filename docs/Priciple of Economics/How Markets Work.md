# How Markets Work

## The Market Forces of Supply and Demand

**Competitive Market**: a market in which there are **many** buyers and many sellers so that each has a **negligible** impact on the market price

**Perfectly Competitive Market**:

1. The goods offered for sale are all exactly the same
2. the buyers and sellers are so numerous that no single buyer or seller has any influence over the market price

Price takers: in a perfectly competitive market, buyers and sellers must accept the price the market determines

Monopoly: only one seller, and this seller sets the price

Oligopoly: a few sellers

Monopolistic Competition: many sellers; slightly different products (compared with identical products in perfectly competition)

### Demand

Quantity Demanded: the **amount** of a good that buyers are **willing** and **able** to purchase

Law of Demand: the claim that, other things being equal, <u>the quantity demanded of a good falls when the price of the good rises</u>

Demand Schedule and Demand Curve:

**The market demand curve** shows how the **total quantity** demanded of a good varies as the price of the good varies.

#### Shifts in Demand Curve

1. Income:
    - Normal Good: a good for which, other things being equal, an **increase** in income leads to an **increase** in demand
    - Inferior Good: a good for which, other things being equal, an **increase** in income leads to a **decrease** in demand
2. Number of buyers
3. Prices of Related Goods:
    - substitutes: two goods for which an **increase in the price** of one leads to an **increase in the demand** for the other
        - e.g. Coca-Cola and Pepsi
    - complements: two goods for which an **increase in the price** of one leads to a **decrease in the demand** for the other
        - e.g. computer and software
4. Tastes
5. Expectations

### Supply

Quantity Supplied: the amount of a good that sellers are **willing** and **able** to sell

Law of Supply: the claim that, other things being equal, the **quantity** supplied of a good **rises** when the **price** of the good **rises**

**Market supply** is the sum of the supplies of all sellers.

#### Shifts in the Supply Curve

1. Input prices
2. Technology
3. Number of sellers
4. Expectations
    - If a firm expects the price of ice cream to rise in the future, it will put some of its current production into storage and <u>supply less to the market today</u>.

### Supply and Demand Together

equilibrium a situation: in which the market price has reached the level at which **quantity supplied equals quantity demanded**

equilibrium price: the price that balances quantity supplied and quantity demanded

equilibrium quantity: the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded at the equilibrium price

Surplus: a situation in which quantity supplied is greater than quantity demanded

Shortage: a situation in which quantity demanded is greater than quantity supplied

#### Three Steps to Analyzing Changes in Equilibrium

1. Decide whether the event shifts the supply or demand curve (or perhaps both).
2. Decide in which direction the curve shifts.
3. Use the supply-and-demand diagram to see how the shift changes the equilibrium price and quantity.

- 如果石油价格上升是由于供给不足，则一定会引起GDP增长下降。
- 相反的，如果较高的石油价格反映的是强劲的需求，那么它就是健康的全球增长的结果（反向因果关系）。
