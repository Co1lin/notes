Marginal Product of Labor: $MPL = {dQ \over dL}$

Value of the Marginal Product of Labor: $VMPL = P \times MPL$ (from amount of production to dollars)

$W$ denotes wage, then $\Delta \text{Profit} = VMPL - W$        

<u>The value-of-marginal-product (**VMPL**) curve is the ***labor-demand curve*** for a competitive, profit-maximizing firm.</u>

**At the equilibrium point, wage (W) = VMPL**

## Earnings and Discrimination

compensating differential: a difference in wages that arises to offset the nonmonetary characteristics of different jobs

human capital: the accumulation of investments in people, such as education and on-the-job training

!!! tips "The Superstar Phenomenon"
