## Measuring a Nation's Income

### The Measurement of GDP

GDP measures two things <u>at once</u>:

1. the total income of everyone in the economy
2. the total expenditure on the economy’s output of goods and services

GDP can perform the trick of measuring both total income and total expenditure because **for an economy as a whole, income must equal expenditure**.

A definition of GDP that focuses on GDP as **a measure of total expenditure**:

**Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.**

Key points:

1. **Market Value**:
    1. GDP uses market prices as the measure for all things
    2. Housing is included:
        1. rental housing
        2. owner-occupied housing: **<u>estimating</u>** its rental value
    3. Public services are included: civil servant (no market, use the cost value to estimate)
    4. Excludes products that don't enter a (legal) market
        1. illegal drugs
        2. products produced and consumed at home: vegetables you grow in your garden
        3. "marriage may reduce GDP"
        4. **rent** of durable goods (like cars, jewelry, except for housing)
2. Final goods: the value of intermediate goods is already included in the prices of the final goods.
3. Produced: GDP includes goods and services **currently produced** (that will enter the market; **inventory** are included). It does not include transactions involving <u>items produced in the past</u>.
4. Within the **geographic confines** of a country: regardless of the nationality of the producer
5. *Seasonal Adjustment*: government statisticians adjust the quarterly data to take out the seasonal cycle.

### The Components of GDP

$$
Y = C + I + G + NX

1. **Consumption**: spending by households on goods and services, with the exception of purchases of new housing

2. **Investment**: the purchase of **goods** (called capital goods) that will be used in the future to produce more goods and services

    the sum of purchases of business capital, residential capital, and inventories

    1. Business capital:

        business structures (such as a factory or office building)

        equipment (such as a worker’s computer)

        intellectual property products (such as the software that runs the computer)

    2. Residential capital:

        the landlord’s apartment building and a homeowner’s personal residence

        (By convention, the purchase of a new house is the one type of household spending categorized as investment rather than consumption.)

    3. **Inventories**:

        Concept: One aim of GDP is to measure the value of the economy’s production, and goods added to inventory are part of that period’s production.

        1. When Apple produces a computer and adds it to its inventory instead of selling it, Apple is assumed to have “purchased” the computer for itself. It is part of Apple’s investment spending.
        2. If Apple later sells the computer out of inventory, Apple’s **inventory investment** will then be negative, offsetting the positive expenditure of the buyer.

3. **Government Purchases**: spending on goods and services by local, state, and federal governments

    salaries of government workers, expenditures on public works

    ***Transfer payments*** are not counted as part of government purchases:

    The government pays a Social Security benefit to a person who is elderly, which is not made in exchange for a currently produced good or service.

4. **Net Exports**: spending on domestically produced goods by foreigners (exports) minus spending on foreign goods by domestic residents (imports)

    Imports are subtracted:

    1. Someone buys product produced abroad increases consumption.
    2. But it should not affect GDP.
    3. So it should be subtracted from exports.

### Real versus Nominal GDP

**Nominal GDP**: the production of goods and services valued at **current prices**

**Real GDP**: the production of goods and services valued at **constant (base-year) prices**
$$
\text{GDP deflator} = { \text{Nominal GDP} \over \text{Real GDP} } \times 100
$$
nominal GDP reflects both:

1. the quantities of goods and services the economy is producing
2. the prices of those goods and services

real GDP reflects only the quantities produced

**The GDP deflator** measures **<u>the current level of prices</u>** relative to the level of prices in the base year.

**The inflation rate** is the percentage change in some measure of the price level from one period to the next. Using the GDP deflator,
$$
\text{Inflation rate in year 2} = { \text{GDP deflator in year 2} - \text{GDP deflator in year 1} \over \text{GDP deflator in year 1} } \times 100
$$
