# The Real Economy in the Long Run

## Production and Growth

### Productivity: Its Role and Determinants

**Productivity**:

- the quantity of goods and services produced from **each unit of** labor input

- Productivity = Y / L

    - Y is the amount of total produced goods and services
    - L is the quantity of labor force

How can workers be more **productive**?

**Physical Capital (K) per Worker**

- **Physical Capital**: the stock of equipment and structures that are used to produce goods and services

**Human Capital (H) per Worker**

- **Human Capital**: the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training, and experience

**Natural Resources (N) per Worker**

- **Natural Resources**: the inputs into the production of goods and services that are provided by nature, such as land, rivers, and mineral deposits

**Technological Knowledge (A)**

- society’s understanding of the best ways to produce goods and services

Formulate the production function:
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y &= A \cdot F(L, K, H, N) \\
\Rightarrow {Y \over L} &= A \cdot F(1, {K \over L}, {H \over L}, {N \over L})
\end{aligned}
$$

### Economic Growth and Public Policy

#### Saving and Investment

capital is a produced factor of production $\Rightarrow$ increase the amount of capital

If today the economy produces a large quantity of new capital goods $\Rightarrow$ <u>tomorrow it will have a larger stock of capital</u> and be able to <u>produce more</u> goods and services.

$\Rightarrow$ invest more current resources in the production of capital 

$\Rightarrow$ **sacrifice consumption of goods and services in the present to enjoy higher consumption in the future**

<u>Encouraging saving and investment</u> is one way that a government can encourage growth and, in the long run, raise an economy’s standard of living.

#### Diminishing Returns and *the Catch-Up Effect*

**Diminishing returns**: the property whereby the benefit from an extra unit of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases

**Catch-up effect**: the property whereby countries that start off poor tend to grow more rapidly than countries that start off rich

Higher saving rate $\Rightarrow$ lower amount of consumption $\Rightarrow$ lower level of happiness

**Solow Model**: there exists an **optimal saving rate**

#### Investment from Abroad

**foreign direct investment**: A capital investment that is owned and operated by a foreign entity

**foreign portfolio investment**: An investment that is financed with foreign money but operated by domestic residents

Investment from abroad is one way for a country to grow.

- Even though some of the benefits from this investment flow back to the foreign owners, this investment does increase the economy’s stock of capital, leading to higher productivity and higher wages.
- Moreover, investment from abroad is one way for poor countries to learn the state-of-the-art technologies developed and used in richer countries.

## Saving, Investment, and the Financial System

### Financial Institutions

**Financial system**: the group of institutions in the economy that help to **match one person’s saving with another person’s investment**

#### Financial Markets

**Financial markets**: financial institutions through which savers can **directly provide** funds to borrowers

**Bond**: a certificate of indebtedness that specifies the obligations of the borrower to the holder of the bond

- date of maturity: the time at which the loan will be repaid
- rate of interest that will be paid periodically until the loan matures

**Stock**: a claim to partial ownership in a firm

#### Financial Intermediaries

**Financial intermediaries**: financial institutions through which savers can indirectly provide funds to borrowers

Banks

**Mutual fund**: an institution that sells shares to the public and uses the proceeds to buy a portfolio of stocks and bonds
