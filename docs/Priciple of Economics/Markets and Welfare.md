Welfare Economics: the study of how the allocation of resources affects economic well-being.

## Consumers, Producers, and the Efficiency of Markets

### Consumer Surplus

The amount a buyer is willing to pay for a good minus the amount the buyer actually pays for it.

### Producer Surplus

Cost: the value of everything a seller must give up to produce a good.

Producer Surplus: the amount a seller is paid for a good minus the sellerâ€™s cost of providing it.

### Market Efficiency

Total surplus

= (Value to buyers - Amount paid by buyers) + (Amount received by sellers - Cost to sellers)

= Value to buyers - Cost to sellers

If an allocation of resources maximizes total surplus, we say that the allocation exhibits **efficiency**.

**Equality**: whether the various buyers and sellers in the market have a similar level of economic well-being.

The market equilibrium maximizes the sum of producer and consumer surplus:

### Market Failure

To conclude that markets are efficient, we made *several assumptions* about how markets work. When these assumptions do not hold, our conclusion that the market equilibrium is efficient may no longer be true.

1. Markets are perfectly competitive.
    - **Market power** can cause markets to be inefficient because it keeps the price and quantity away from the levels determined by the equilibrium of supply and demand.
2. The *outcome* in a market matters only to the buyers and sellers who participate in that market.
    - side effects; **externalities**

## Application: The Costs of Taxation

The fall in total surplus that results when a tax (or some other policy) distorts a market outcome is called a **deadweight loss**.

The price elasticities of supply and demand are determinants of the deadweight loss.

**The greater the elasticities** of supply and demand, **the greater the deadweight loss** of a tax.
