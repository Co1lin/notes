## Externalities

### Externalities and Market Inefficiency

<u>The market failures</u> examined in this chapter fall under a general category called externalities.

Externality: the uncompensated impact of one person’s actions on the well-being of a <u>bystander</u> (a person who sees sth. that is happening but is not involved)

positive / negative externality

Internalizing the externality: altering incentives so that people take into account the external effects of their actions

- Negative externalities lead markets to produce a larger quantity than is socially desirable.

    - The government can **internalize the externality** by taxing goods that have negative externalities

- Positive externalities lead markets to produce a smaller quantity than is socially desirable.

    - The government can and **subsidizing** goods that have positive externalities.

- Supply curve -> private & external cost
- Demand curve -> private and external benefit

### Public Policies toward Externaties

1. Command-and-Control Policies: Regulation
2. Market-Based Policy 1: **Corrective Taxes** and Subsidies
3. Market-Based Policy 2: Tradable Pollution Permits

### Private Solutions to Externalities

**The Coase Theorem**: If private parties can bargain over the allocation of resources **at no cost**, then the private market will always solve the problem of externalities and allocate resources efficiently.

*The Coase theorem says that private economic actors can potentially solve the problem of externalities among themselves. Whatever the **initial distribution of rights**, the interested parties can reach a bargain in which everyone is better off and the outcome is efficient.*

## Public Goods and Common Resources

Excludability: the property of a good whereby a person can be prevented from using it

Rivalry in consumption: the property of a good whereby one person’s use diminishes other people’s use

Public goods and common resources have no price, not excludable, but have value. Markets may fail in allocating them.

### Public Goods

Free rider: a person who receives the benefit of a good but avoids paying for it

- Because public goods are **not excludable**, the free-rider problem prevents the private market from supplying them.
- The government, however, can remedy the problem. If the government decides that the total benefits of a public good exceed its costs, it can provide the public good, pay for it with tax revenue, and potentially make everyone better off.
- However, it is hard to evaluate the benefits. Thus it is more difficult to provide efficient public goods than to provide private goods.

### Common Resources

Examples: Clean air & water, oil, Congested Roads, ...

Tragedy of the Commons

Solutions:

1. Regulation
2. Corrective Taxes (internalized the externality by taxing sheep)
3. Auctioned off a limited number of sheep-grazing permits
4. Split and sell to families
