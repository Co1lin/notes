# Firm Behavior and the Organization of Industry

## The Costs of Production

Total revenue: the amount a firm receives for the sale of its output

Total cost: the market value of the inputs a firm uses in production

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost

Explicit costs: input costs that require an **outlay** of money by the firm

- wage

Implicit costs: input costs that <u>do not require an outlay</u> of money by the firm

- opportunity cost of time
- opportunity cost of money

Accounting Profit = Total Revenue - Explicit Cost

Economic Profit = Total Revenue - Explicit Cost - Implicit Cost

### Production and Costs

Production Function: Quantity of output - Quantity of inputs

**Marginal Product** (of Labour) (MPL): $\text{MPL} = {\Delta Q \over \Delta L}$

MPK (Marginal Product of Capital)

Diminishing Marginal Product: the property whereby the marginal product of an input declines as the quantity of the input increases

### The Various Measures of Cost

Total-Cost Curve: Total Cost - Quantity of Output

Total Cost = Fixed Cost + Variable Costs

Average Total Cost = Total Cost / Quantity

Average Fixed Cost = Fixed Cost / Quantity

Average Variable Cost = Variable Cost / Quantity

**Marginal Cost**: $\text{MC} = {\Delta TC \over \Delta Q}$

Two features:

- Rising Marginal Cost
- U-Shaped Average Total Cost
    - efficient scale: the quantity of output that minimizes average total cost

The marginal-cost curve crosses the average-total-cost curve at the minimum of average total cost (efficient scale: the quantity of output that minimizes average total cost).

### Costs in the Short Run and in the Long Run

Many decisions are **fixed in the short run but variable in the long run**, a firm’s long-run cost curves differ from its short-run cost curves.

Different production scale and choice:

Economies of Scale: the property whereby long-run average total cost falls as the quantity of output increases

Diseconomies of Scale: the property whereby long-run average total cost rises as the quantity of output increases

Constant Returns to Scale: the property whereby long-run average total cost stays the same as the quantity of output changes

## Firms in Competitive Markets

Average Revenue: total revenue / the quantity sold = TR / Q := Price

Marginal Revenue: $MR = {\Delta TR \over \Delta Q}$

**For competitive firms, MR = AR = P**

### Profit Maximization

MR > MC, increase the production of milk

MR < MC, decrease

- Horizontal Price Line: a competitive firm is the price taker
- MR = MC -> Optimal -> P = MR = MC
- In such case, marginal-cost curve determines the quantity of the good the firm is willing to supply at any price -> **MC Curve is also Supply Curve**

### Short-Run and Long-Run Decisions

- Shutdown (short term):
    - pay fixed costs
    - lose total revenue
    - save variable costs
    - TR < VC ⟺ TR/Q < VC/Q ⟺ **P < AVC**
    - compares the price it receives for the typical unit to the average variable cost that it must incur to produce the typical unit
    - The competitive firm’s short-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that **lies above average variable cost**.

    - sunk cost: a cost that has already been committed and cannot be recovered
- Exit / Enter a Market (Long-Run Decision)
    - Exit if TR < TC ⟺ TR/Q < TC/Q ⟺ **P < ATC**
    
    - Enter if P > ATC
    
    - The competitive firm’s long-run supply curve is the portion of its marginal-cost curve that **lies above average total cost**.

    - Profit = PQ - TC = (P - ATC) × Q

The Short Run

- Market Supply with a Fixed Number of Firms
- The quantity of output supplied to the market equals the sum of the quantities supplied by each firms.

The Long Run

- Market Supply with Entry and Exit
- **At the end of this process of entry and exit, firms that remain in the market must be making *zero economic profit*.**
- Profit = (P - ATC) × Q
- In the long-run equilibrium of a competitive market with free entry and exit, firms must be operating at their ***efficient scale***.
- The long-run market supply curve must be horizontal at the price with zero economic profit—the minimum of ATC.

A Shift in Demand

Entry and exit can cause the long-run market supply curve to be **perfectly elastic**.

Long-Run Supply Curve Might **Slope Upward** (price may rise)

- some resources used in production may be available only in limited quantities
- firms may have different costs
    - For any given price, those with lower costs are more likely to enter than those with higher costs.
    - To increase the quantity of painting services supplied, additional entrants must be encouraged to enter the market.
    - New entrants have higher costs, so the price must rise to make entry profitable for them.
    - Some firms earn profit even in the long run
        - The price in the market reflects the **average total cost of the marginal firm**—the firm that would exit the market if the price were any lower.
        - Entry does not eliminate this profit <u>because would-be entrants have higher costs than firms already in the market</u>.
        - Higher-cost firms will enter only if the price rises, making the market profitable for them.



## Monopoly

### Barriers to Entry & Reasons

- Monopoly resources: own a key resource

- Government regulation: exclusive right to produce

- Natural Monopolies:

    A **single** firm can produce output at a **lower cost** than can **a larger number** of firms.

    A single firm can supply a good or service to an entire market at a lower cost than could two or more firms.

    A firm’s **average-total-cost** curve continually **declines**.
