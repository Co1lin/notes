# Money and Prices in the Long Run

## The Monetary System

### Money

Money: the set of assets in an economy that people regularly use to buy goods and services from other people

The Functions of Money:

- medium of exchange
- unit of account
- store of value: transfer purchasing power from the present to the future
- liquidity: the ease with which an asset can be converted into the economy’s medium of exchange

The Kinds of Money:

- **commodity money**: money that takes the form of a commodity with **intrinsic value** (e.g. gold)
- **fiat money**: money without intrinsic value that is used as money by government decree (official order)

Money in the economy:

- currency: the paper bills and coins in the hands of the public
- demand deposits (活期储蓄): balances in bank accounts that depositors can access on demand by writing a check

### The Federal Reserve System

The Fed has two related jobs:

- regulate banks and ensure the health of the banking system
    - *lender of last resort*—a lender to those who cannot borrow anywhere else—to maintain stability in the overall banking system
- monetary policy: control the quantity of money that is made available in the economy
    - Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
    - Fed’s primary tool: open-market operation: the purchase and sale of U.S. government bonds

### Banks and the Money Supply

reserves: deposits that banks have received but have not loaned out

reserve ratio $R$ : **the fraction of deposits** that banks hold as reserves

money multiplier: the amount of money the banking system generates with each dollar of **reserves**
$$
\text{money multiplier} = {1 \over R}
$$

leverage (杠杆): the use of borrowed money to supplement existing funds for purposes of investment

leverage ratio: the ratio of assets to bank capital
$$
\text{leverage ratio} = {\text{assets} \over \text{capital}}
$$
capital requirement: a government regulation specifying a minimum amount of bank capital

### The Fed’s Tools of Monetary Control

How the Fed Influences the Quantity of Reserves:

- Open-Market Operations
- Fed Lending to Banks
    - **discount rate** (贴现率): the interest rate on the loans that the Fed makes to banks
    - The Fed can alter the money supply by changing the discount rate.

How the Fed Influences the Reserve Ratio:

- reserve requirements
- Paying Interest on Reserves: when a bank holds reserves on deposit at the Fed, the Fed now pays the bank interest on those deposits

**The Federal Funds Rate**:

- the short-term interest rate that banks charge one another for loans (the loans are temporary—typically overnight)
- the Federal Reserve has set a target goal for the federal funds rate
- open-market purchases lower the federal funds rate, and open-market sales raise the federal funds rate
- Decisions by the FOMC to change the target for the federal funds rate are also decisions to change the money supply. They are two sides of the same coin.

## Money Growth and Inflation

### The Classical Theory of Inflation

explain the longrun determinants of the price level and the inflation rate

#### Classical Dichotomy

**classical dichotomy**: the separation of real and nominal variables

**monetary neutrality**: the proposition that changes in the money supply do not affect **real variables**

#### Quantity Equation

**velocity of money**: the rate at which money changes hands
$$
V = {\text{nominal value of output} \over \text{quantity of money}} = {\text{nominal GDP} \over M} = {P \times Y \over M}
$$

where $P$ is the price level (**the GDP deflator**) and $Y$ is the real GDP

**quantity equation**: relates the quantity of money, the velocity of money, and the dollar value of the economy’s output of goods and services

$$
\begin{aligned}
V \times M &= P \times Y \\ \\
\Rightarrow {{\rm d}M \over M} + {{\rm d}V \over V} &= {{\rm d}P \over P} + {{\rm d}Y \over Y} \\
{{\rm d}V \over V} = 0 \Rightarrow {{\rm d}M \over M} &= {{\rm d}P \over P} + {{\rm d}Y \over Y}
\end{aligned}
$$

**increase rate of the quantity of money = increase rate of price level (inflation) + increase rate of quantity of output (real GDP)**

**inflation tax**: the revenue the government raises by creating money

#### The Fisher Effect

Fisher effect: the one-for-one adjustment of the nominal interest rate to the inflation rate
$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Real interest rate} &= \text{Nominal interest rate} - \text{Inflation rate} \\
\Rightarrow \text{Nominal interest rate} &= \text{Real interest rate} + \text{Inflation rate}
\end{aligned}
$$

### The Costs of Inflation

inflation does not in itself reduce people’s real purchasing power

- Shoeleather Costs: the resources wasted when inflation encourages people to reduce their money holdings
- Menu Costs: the costs of changing prices
- Relative-Price Variability and the Misallocation of Resources
- Inflation-Induced Tax Distortions
- Confusion and Inconvenience
- A Special Cost of **Unexpected Inflation**: Arbitrary Redistributions of Wealth
