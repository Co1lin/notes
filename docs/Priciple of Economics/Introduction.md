## Ten Principles of Economics

### How People Make Decisions

- Tradeoffs
- Cost (more concerned about opportunities, other alternatives)
- Margin (e.g. why something is cheap or not)
    - Compare marginal cost and benefits to make decisions
- Incentives (planned economy vs market economy)
    - Prices, Property Rights, ... are important incentives in the economy
    - Consider the indirect effects of incentives

### How People Interact

- Trade (Invisible hand)
- Markets
- Governments (Market failures)

### How the Economy as a Whole Works

- Production
- Money
- Inflation and unemployment
