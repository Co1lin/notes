(Compared with "allocation"; e.g. stealing)

## Ten Principles of Economics

### How People Make Decisions

- Tradeoffs
- Cost (more concerned about opportunities, other alternatives)
- Margin (e.g. why something is cheap or not)
    - Compare marginal cost and benefits to make decisions
- Incentives (planned economy vs market economy)
    - Prices, Property Rights, ... are important incentives in the economy
    - Consider the indirect effects of incentives

### How People Interact

- Trade (Invisible hand)
- Markets
- Governments (Market failures)

### How the Economy as a Whole Works

- Production
- Money
- Inflation and unemployment

## Thinking Like an Economist

Economics as Science (explain) or Policy (change the world)

## Interdependence and the Gains from Trade

### Production Possibilities Frontier

Production Possibilities Frontier: the various mixes of output that an economy can produce.

Consumption Possibilities Frontier: If there is no trade, each personâ€™s production possibilities frontier **is also** his or her consumption possibilities frontier.

**Trade expands the set of consumption opportunities.**

### How to measure the cost or advantage

**Absolute advantage**: the ability to produce a good **using fewer inputs than another** producer, used to compare the productivity of one person

**Opportunity cost**: whatever must be given up to obtain some item

**Comparative advantage**: the ability to produce a good **at a lower opportunity cost** than another producer

It is **comparative advantage** that decides:

1. Specialization: specializes in activities in which one has a comparative advantage.
2. The Price of the Trade: must lie between the two opportunity costs.

Thus a country still needs to trade with others even it has absolute advantage on all aspects. Because:

- <u>Having absolute advantage doesn't mean having comparative advantage</u>.
- The gains from trade are based on comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.

> International trade can make some individuals worse off, even as it makes the country as a whole better off. When the United States exports food and imports cars, the impact on an American farmer is not the same as the impact on an American autoworker.
