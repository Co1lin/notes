# Welcome to Colin's Notebook

This is my personal notebook, in which I will write down some CS related things.

(Update in 2021 Fall: not only CS related; some economics or other things I interested in are also included.)

Since I can't find a satisfying notebook project which supports online editing, managing on web, and using Markdown, I adopt "an editing everywhere and CI/CD publishing" way. GitHub ensures data reliability and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) equipped with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) provides a nice rendering effect.

Note that I am not intended to publish these notes providing others something to learn, so some of these notes may wrong, due to my limited understanding of knowledges when I write them down. Since it is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Co1lin/notes), you are welcomed to pull requests for my mistakes, or reach me to let me know through email or [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Co1lin/notes/issues).
