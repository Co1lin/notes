This is my personal notebook, in which I will record some CS related things.

Since I can't find a satisfying notebook project which supports online editing and managing on web, and also using Markdown, now I use code-server to edit and this MkDocs project to publish. The files are also availiable on [GitHub](https://github.com/Co1lin/notes), so you can pull requests.
